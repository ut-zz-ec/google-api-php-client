Hi.

Sorry by using this way.

In short, We are a university called UTEC and We can't create a github account like 
https://github.com/utec or https://utec.github.io for our students because your username is : utec

Please take a look to our website :

https://www.utec.edu.pe/en

Appealing to your good sense , please could you change your username in order to allow us create our account.

Thank you so much.

Regards
Richard Leon
